Datafile:
- 100 consumer datasets (named "consumer-00000xxx.csv")
- 100 prosumer datasets (named "producer-00000xxx.csv")

Input: 100 consumer/prosumer data sets containing energy consumption/production in 3-minute intervals for one year (2017)

Output: csv-files containing simulation results, plots of consumer/prosumer's energy consumption/production, plot of battery simulation
